description: "The Tale of Jemima Puddle-Duck is a children's book written and illustrated\
  \ by Beatrix Potter. It was first published by Frederick Warne & Co. in July 1908.\
  \ Potter composed the book at Hill Top, a working farm in the Lake District she\
  \ bought in 1905. Following the purchase, her works began to focus on country and\
  \ village life, incorporating large casts of animal characters and sinister villains.\
  \ Jemima Puddle-Duck was the first of her books set wholly at the farm with background\
  \ illustrations based on the farm buildings and yard, and nearby locales.\nJemima\
  \ is a domestic duck of the Aylesbury breed, whose eggs are routinely confiscated\
  \ by the farmer's wife because she believes Jemima a poor sitter. Jemima searches\
  \ for a place away from the farm where she can hatch her eggs without human interference,\
  \ and naively confides her woes to a suave fox who invites her to nest in a shed\
  \ at his home. Jemima accepts his invitation, little realising her danger: the fox\
  \ plans to kill and roast her. Kep, a collie on the farm, discovers Jemima's whereabouts\
  \ and rescues her just in time. Potter indicated the tale was a revision of \"Little\
  \ Red Riding Hood\" with Jemima, the fox, and the dog parallels to the fairy tale's\
  \ heroine, wolf, and woodcutter. Jemima, Kep, the farmer's wife, and her two children\
  \ were all modelled on real world individuals at Potter's Hill Top farm.\nThe book\
  \ was hugely popular. Spinoff merchandise included a soft Jemima doll in bonnet\
  \ and shawl, a Jemima painting book in 1925, and illustrated fabric placemats hand-fashioned\
  \ by Potter and distributed to friends. Critically, the book is considered one of\
  \ Potter's best. In 1971, the tale became a segment in the Royal Ballet film, The\
  \ Tales of Beatrix Potter, and, in 1992, it was telecast as an episode on the animated\
  \ BBC anthology series, The World of Peter Rabbit and Friends.\n From Wikipedia\
